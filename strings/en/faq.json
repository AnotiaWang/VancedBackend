Note this again, "VANCED IS NOT YOUTUBE PREMIUM". 

You could use some apps like NewPipe, Videoder, Tubemate, SnapTube, or a Telegram bot to download videos if don't live in one of the supported countries. Please do not ask for links of these apps in group.

⚠️⚠️Vanced will never add any sort of third party downloader to the app.⚠️ Not only it is a hassle for the developers to maintain, but it also gives Google one more reason to send a takedown notice, meaning that the development will be ceased for Vanced.

Nobody wants that, so downloading from other sources/YouTube videos from within the Vanced app will never be supported. Please don’t ask if the developers can add that feature. If you can’t download from the Vanced app, then use one of the alternative apps above.⚠️"

Its totally depends upon those video uploader's who are not including subtitles or not providing any information to be given with info button and vanced have nothing to do with it.

            "title": "Why Split apks",
            "description": "First of all, what are split apks and how do we benefit from them:

1.  What are split apks?
It's a zip file which contains the base apk, config apk for your device architecture and language apk.

For example, a typical normal apk has both 32 bit and 64 bit support file, lots of language files and a base apk. So if your device is only 32 bit for example and you only want english language file, why would you want an extra files which you don't even need and will result in taking huge space in your storage.

> Advantages:
  • size of split apk is almost half of normal apk
  • a split apk only has those files which are relevant for your device and architecture

> Disadvantages:
  Difficult to newbies or non-technical people

2. Why split?

Google only distributes the YouTube APKs after version 14.54 in split APKs now , so in order to install Vanced, we have to use SAI (Split APK Installer).
Previously, they provides normal apk making it easy to install apps on every device.

3. why dev's don't patch apks and make apk from it?

It's not like that they can't. It's about increased time in doing this. Converting from apks to apk adds time which they can use that in other ways(both personal and vanced bugs/updates). So please don't ask how to get normal apk. Use old version if you are really lazy or official YT app from play store directly."

However, Non-Root installer can now use the already downloaded files to reinstall Vanced. "

            "title": "Microphone",
            "description": "If you're wondering why there is no microphone permission in the root version of Vanced, that's because the APK used to modify Vanced (minAPI17) is missing the microphone permission. The other APK has it (minAPI21) but that lacks the translation. Why? Ask Google 🤷‍♂️

Workaround: use the non-root variant, or stock YouTube.

NOTE: These issues only exists in version 14 and below. The permissions are now fixed from version 15."

            "description": "1. What is Exoplayer?
ExoPlayer is an application level media player for Android. It provides an alternative to Android’s MediaPlayer API for playing audio and video both locally and over the Internet. ExoPlayer supports features not currently supported by Android’s MediaPlayer API, including DASH and SmoothStreaming adaptive playbacks. Unlike the MediaPlayer API, ExoPlayer is easy to customize and extend, and can be updated through Play Store application updates.

2. Difference between V1 and V2?
V1:

  > Better optimised for low end devices. 

  > Can switch to v1 if V2 starts giving issues to you.

V2: 

  > not supported by low end devices. Might give issues on low end crashes, can cause crashes, glitches, lags, black screen. 

  > More optimised for latest devices released after 2019

NOTE: With version 15.33.34, Exoplayer V2 is forced by Google so if V2 gives issue on your device, switch to V1.

PSA: ExoPlayer V2 is EXPERIMENTAL, don't use it unless you know what you're doing. Don't report crashes if you have it enabled. If you are facing crashes/lags/glitches/etc, Switch to Exoplayer v1."

1. You need to have at least Pico Gapps to run vanced.

2. You can’t run vanced with microG core because it needs Google Play Services Framework which is available in all Gapps packages.

3. If you are worried about your privacy & don’t want to use Gapps but still want to use Vanced then there are old Nokia phones still available in the market. :)

• Go to Settings > Apps > YouTube. It should show "Uninstall" on the top left. DO NOT Uninstall! Just see if it says that there!

• Reboot

• Go to Settings > Apps > YouTube. Now it should say "Disable" or "Deactivate". DO NOT Uninstall! Just see if it says that there!

However, YouTube has lifted this cap now. So you can ignore whatever being said below. If you still have 480p as maximum while the video resolution showing on desktop is higher, you can use below workaround as a temporary fix until Google removes the cap in your region/on your network.

Now if you are looking for any WORKAROUNDS to Bypass this, 

1) You can try with VPN if you are lucky. YouTube applied this in most countries so you have to pick your new region wisely.

2) Watch on desktop mode [www(dot)youtube(dot)com]

3) Since the 480p restriction is only for mobile devices and not tablets we can change the model of the device in YouTube Vanced to overcome the restriction.

a) Open YouTube Vanced

b) Enable additional options by going to Settings -> Vanced Settings -> Tap on the About section till you get a message saying hidden Menu is visible

c) Go to Codec override -> Override model and enter the model number of any tab e.g. "SM-T865" and device to "Samsung"

d) Restart the app and the 480p limit should be gone now

e) Enjoy
