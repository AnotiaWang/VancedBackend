			"description": "Downloading videos is only available in these(https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6141269) countries & you can download any video which is FREE to download. Videos needing YouTube Premium will never get downloaded so if you see YT premium dialogue when downloading some videos, BUY YouTube PREMIUM FOR IT.\n\nNote this again, \"VANCED IS NOT YOUTUBE PREMIUM\". \n\nYou could use some apps like NewPipe, Videoder, Tubemate, SnapTube, or a Telegram bot to download videos if don't live in one of the supported countries. Please do not ask for links of these apps in group.\n\n⚠️⚠️Vanced will never add any sort of third party downloader to the app.⚠️ Not only it is a hassle for the developers to maintain, but it also gives Google one more reason to send a takedown notice, meaning that the development will be ceased for Vanced.\n\nNobody wants that, so downloading from other sources/YouTube videos from within the Vanced app will never be supported. Please don’t ask if the developers can add that feature. If you can’t download from the Vanced app, then use one of the alternative apps above.⚠️"

		{
			"title": "Why Split apks",
			"description": "First of all, what are split apks and how do we benefit from them:\n\n1.  What are split apks?\nIt's a zip file which contains the base apk, config apk for your device architecture and language apk.\n\nFor example, a typical normal apk has both 32 bit and 64 bit support file, lots of language files and a base apk. So if your device is only 32 bit for example and you only want english language file, why would you want an extra files which you don't even need and will result in taking huge space in your storage.\n\n> Advantages:\n  • size of split apk is almost half of normal apk\n  • a split apk only has those files which are relevant for your device and architecture\n\n> Disadvantages:\n  Difficult to newbies or non-technical people\n\n2. Why split?\n\nGoogle only distributes the YouTube APKs after version 14.54 in split APKs now , so in order to install Vanced, we have to use SAI (Split APK Installer).\nPreviously, they provides normal apk making it easy to install apps on every device.\n\n3. why dev's don't patch apks and make apk from it?\n\nIt's not like that they can't. It's about increased time in doing this. Converting from apks to apk adds time which they can use that in other ways(both personal and vanced bugs/updates). So please don't ask how to get normal apk. Use old version if you are really lazy or official YT app from play store directly."

			"title": "App Splash color",
			"description": "Splash screen background color is now taken from Android framework color (Android system) to make sure Vanced/Youtube changes its splash According to system theme. Whatever be the Android framework color, the same color vanced will show.\n\nYou can use Substratum/Swift themes to change the theme color."

		{
			"title": "Redownload",
			"description": "The reason is pretty simple: sometimes downloaded file can be corrupted, trying to grab them and install will result in infinite loop of failure, to avoid this manager redownloads files every time you press button.\n\nHowever, Non-Root installer can now use the already downloaded files to reinstall Vanced."
		},
		{
			"title": "Microphone",
			"description": "If you're wondering why there is no microphone permission in the root version of Vanced, that's because the APK used to modify Vanced (minAPI17) is missing the microphone permission. The other APK has it (minAPI21) but that lacks the translation. Why? Ask Google 🤷‍♂️\n\nWorkaround: use the non-root variant, or stock YouTube.\n\nNOTE: These issues only exists in version 14 and below. The permissions are now fixed from version 15."

			"title": "Exoplayer",
			"description": "1. What is Exoplayer?\nExoPlayer is an application level media player for Android. It provides an alternative to Android’s MediaPlayer API for playing audio and video both locally and over the Internet. ExoPlayer supports features not currently supported by Android’s MediaPlayer API, including DASH and SmoothStreaming adaptive playbacks. Unlike the MediaPlayer API, ExoPlayer is easy to customize and extend, and can be updated through Play Store application updates.\n\n2. Difference between V1 and V2?\nV1:\n\n  > Better optimised for low end devices. \n\n  > Can switch to v1 if V2 starts giving issues to you.\n\nV2: \n\n  > not supported by low end devices. Might give issues on low end crashes, can cause crashes, glitches, lags, black screen. \n\n  > More optimised for latest devices released after 2019\n\nNOTE: With version 15.33.34, Exoplayer V2 is forced by Google so if V2 gives issue on your device, switch to V1.\n\nPSA: ExoPlayer V2 is EXPERIMENTAL, don't use it unless you know what you're doing. Don't report crashes if you have it enabled. If you are facing crashes/lags/glitches/etc, Switch to Exoplayer v1."

You need to have at least Pico Gapps to run vanced.\n\n2. You can’t run vanced with microG core because it needs Google Play Services Framework which is available in all Gapps packages.\n\n3. If you are worried about your privacy & don’t want to use Gapps but still want to use Vanced then there are old Nokia phones still available in the market. :)"

			"title": "Apk Signing",
			"description": "In newest Vanced versions till V15.40.37, you should disable apk signature verification in order to install Vanced using Split Apk Installer, but many users choose \"sign apk\" option in SAI which will cause crashes in Vanced. \n\n*Do not enable options you weren't asked to enable! *\n\nIn order to solve crashes, just reinstall Vanced but this time disable sign apk option in SAI."
