        	"description": "- Root: \nThe root variant of Vanced seamlessly replaces the official YouTube app. As a result, you can directly open YouTube links or call them using Google assistant through the modded vanced app.\n- Non-Root:\n- However, if you have a device that is difficult to root or you donâ€™t want to root your daily driver on the first hand, you should opt for the non-root variant. \n- It can be installed on a rooted device as well. Since the package name of the non-root variant is different from the stock YouTube app, they can co-exist. Note that you need to install an additional companion app (Vanced microG) to be able to log in with your YouTube/Google account. \n- Moreover, you have to manually set Vanced as the default app for opening YouTube links. \n- However, the non-root variant is simply easier to live with, so our recommendation is to stick with the non-root variant unless you really need to replace the stock YouTube app on your phone."
